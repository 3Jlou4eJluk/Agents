**Subject:** Pattern I noticed at Acme Corp

Hi Michael,

Saw Acme just crossed 500 employees and expanded into enterprise. Congrats on the traction.

One pattern we've seen with companies at this stage: sales ops starts breaking down not from lack of process, but from too many tools that don't talk to each other. Reps end up spending more time on data entry than actual selling.

Curious if you're seeing any friction there as you scale the GTM motion?

Happy to share what we've seen work for similar stage companies if it's useful.

Best,
Almas
