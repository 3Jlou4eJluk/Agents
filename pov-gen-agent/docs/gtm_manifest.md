# ResolveOnce - GTM Strategy 2025

## Core Problem Statement

**The primary problem is not tools—it's the process of closing tickets:**

- **"Incomplete resolution or closure of tickets is every service desk's horror"**
- 40% annual turnover in IT support = loss of institutional memory
- 28.6% negative experience from "I had to explain my case several times"
- Agents waste time re-solving already-solved problems
- Knowledge loss when experienced agents leave = reduced service quality

**Focus: Fixing the resolution process, not replacing tools**

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Universal Target: "Teams with ticket closure chaos" (90% of market)

**Problem Profile (universal):**
- **Size:** 50-1,500 employees
- **IT/Support team:** 3-50 specialists

**Decision-maker characteristics:**
- **IT Support Manager / Team Lead**
- **Head of Customer Success / Operations Manager**
- **CTO / IT Director** in growing companies

**Universal pain points (tool-independent):**
- Tickets closed without complete resolution
- Agents repeatedly solve already-solved problems
- Knowledge lost when experienced agents leave
- Customers explain problems multiple times (ticket bouncing)
- New agents overwhelmed by lack of access to collective knowledge
- "Horror" of incomplete resolutions creates reputation damage

### Segmentation by pain points, NOT by tools:

**Segment A: "Knowledge Loss Crisis" (30%)**
- High agent turnover (25%+ annual)
- Departing agents take tribal knowledge with them
- New hires take 3-6 months to become productive

**Segment B: "Ticket Bouncing Hell" (40%)**
- Customers complain "I had to explain several times"
- Multiple reassignments between agents/departments
- Poor categorization and routing

**Segment C: "Incomplete Resolution Nightmare" (30%)**
- Tickets marked "resolved" but problems persist
- Missing documentation at closure
- Subtasks and child tickets remain open

2. **Operational Chaos Signals**
   - Evidence of ticket resolution challenges in their background
   - Experience with ITIL, support processes, or knowledge management
   - Career progression showing operational leadership
   - Signs of managing team scaling challenges

3. **Pain Point Indicators**
   - High agent turnover mentioned in company/role context
   - Ticket handling and resolution in job responsibilities
   - Knowledge management or documentation challenges
