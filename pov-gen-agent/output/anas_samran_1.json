When experienced agents leave, their tribal knowledge disappears, leading to incomplete ticket resolutions and customer frustration\u2014especially in complex, multilingual environments.\n\nThis can undermine ITIL processes and team efficiency, despite best efforts.\n\nCurious if this challenge resonates in your current role at Eastnets?\n\nBest,  \nAlmas",

  "pov_feedback": "Score: 9/10\n\nIssues:\n- Context is based on historical career data rather than a recent, observable event or company-specific development.\n\nFix:\n- Strengthen context by referencing a recent job change, company announcement, or current initiative at Eastnets to make it more timely and engaging.",
