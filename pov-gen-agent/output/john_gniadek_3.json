Even your best resolvers can't access the proven solutions your team has already developed for similar situations.\n\nThis often leads to customers having to explain their issues multiple times and inconsistent resolution quality - especially challenging when experienced team members move on or your operation scales.\n\nHave you explored ways to systematically capture and share your team's collective resolution expertise to prevent this knowledge loss?\n\nBest,  \nAlmas",

  "gtm_feedback": "Score: 9/10\n\nIssues:\n- No explicit mention of ticket closure/resolution process (the core problem focus)\n- Missing specific reference to \"incomplete resolution\" or \"ticket bouncing\" terminology\n\nFix:\n- Add brief reference to \"ticket closure process\" or \"resolution workflow\" to align with core positioning\n- Include one phrase about \"ensuring complete resolution before closure\" to reinforce the primary value proposition\n\nThis is an excellent ICP match that demonstrates deep understanding of the knowledge loss problem, targets the right decision-maker in a B2B SaaS context, and uses authentic pain point language that resonates with the target segments.",
  "pov_feedback": "Score: 9/10\n\nIssues:\n- Context could be slightly more specific about current role/company\n- Observation uses \"we see\" phrasing which slightly reduces peer-to-peer tone\n\nFix:\n- Add specific context about current company/role (e.g., \"Noticed you're now leading CS at [Current Company] after your experience at Connectbase\")\n- Rephrase observation to \"One pattern that emerges\" instead of \"we see\" for more peer-to-peer tone\n- Consider adding brief PS about potential solution category (e.g., \"PS: Knowledge capture systems can reduce resolution time by 40% for scaling teams\")\n\nThis email demonstrates excellent framework adherence with strong personalization, valuable insight, clear problem articulation, and a perfect soft CTA. The minor improvements would elevate it to a 10/10 example.",
