His role spans cross-functional GTM operations including sales, marketing, and customer success - functions directly impacted by support ticket chaos. His profile shows strong operational leadership experience with patents demonstrating process optimization expertise (40% efficiency improvements). He has managed teams and led strategic initiatives involving customer-facing operations, and his current role requires overseeing operational processes where ticket resolution, knowledge management, and team efficiency would be critical pain points. His background in scaling operations and cross-functional collaboration indicates he faces the operational chaos described in the target ICP.",

As COO, he has direct decision-making authority over operational processes and tools. His profile shows strong operational focus with recommendations highlighting his expertise in 'Facilities/Operations Management,' delivering projects 'professionally and to strict deadlines,' and supporting 'IT and Operational issues.' The company's FNOL (First Notification of Loss) service mentioned in his activity involves 24/7 support operations with potential ticket handling challenges. His role overseeing operations in a service-based legal/insurance environment inherently deals with operational chaos in support processes, team management, and process optimization.",

As Rob Fox from CoBank's Knowledge Exchange notes, \"The pool of available workers is set to shrink precipitously in the next few years.\" Key factors: • Declining labor force participation • Falling U.S. fertility rates • Baby boomer retirements • Restrictive immigration policies This perfect storm threatens to impede economic growth, particularly in the Upper Midwest, Corn Belt, and Central Plains. Simply posting job openings on multiple job boards and hoping for applicants won't cut it anymore. Agribusinesses must proactively address current and future talent needs. It's time to: - Invest in technology to offset labor shortages - Develop innovative recruitment strategies - Create compelling retention programs - Build robust talent pipelines Don't wait for the impact to hit. It's time to take action to maintain your competitive edge. The future of your business depends on your ability to attract, develop, and retain top talent.

In the chart is Terrain's estimate of fall supply (this year’s production + carryover grain) using either of their estimates, compared with total storage capacity (on- and off- farm but excluding temporary storage) measured by the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service.   Across much of the Midwest, Terrain projects that supply could exceed storage capacity by a noticeable margin.   This could have important implications for harvest basis (and the change once harvest begins) in some locations and the need for temporary storage.

The proposed changes to the H-2A program reflect many of the reforms that the U.S. Apple Association has long advocated for, including adopting a more market-based system that eliminates the use of the flawed Farm Labor Survey for calculating the AEWR. #farming #labor #apples\n    \n       172\n    \n    3 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jim-bair-34523a12_farming-labor-apples-activity-7379598038052536320-NMD1?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts) \n    \n\nShow more posts Show fewer posts\n\n## Explore collaborative articles\n\nWe’re unlocking community knowledge in a new way.

His focus is on technology leadership, business development, and delivering client projects rather than internal operational chaos in support functions. Company appears to be a services provider rather than having the internal support operations challenges described in the ICP.",

The profile shows no signals of managing support operations, IT teams, customer success, or service desks. His experience focuses on entrepreneurship, scaling companies, and operational leadership in consumer-facing businesses rather than the ticket/support workflow challenges ResolveOnce targets. While he has decision-making authority as COO, there's no evidence he deals with the specific pain points of incomplete ticket closures, agent turnover, or ticket bouncing in support/IT operations. The company context also doesn't align with B2B/SaaS environments with heavy support operations.",

The company appears to be a service provider rather than having the internal operational chaos described in the target ICP.

I do recall it was in 2001…or so. But, what I can tell you with absolute certainty is that if you want inspiration, if you want to see how “it” is supposed to be done…then you need to meet Jon Bartos by any means you can. Yes, he’s one of the top recruiters in the world, and so if you’re considering using his recruiting services all I can ask is what are you waiting for? Yes, he’s one of the top speakers and motivators in the recruiting industry, although of course his sales and performance messages are utterly universal. Yes, he’s attained the heights (literally) of being one of America’s most winning pole-vaulters and obviously knows how to set goals and hit them with his entire body. Perhaps it is that hitting goals thing that I can give my greatest testament to. Not only does Jon know how to set and hit goals – and he’s written important books on the topic – he is surely at the pinnacle of numerical goal setting and tracking of performance numbers in every conceivable way. Yep, that’s the one thing I’ll stand behind the most in my recommendation for Jon. When he speaks about performance, performance numbers, setting, tracking and hitting goals, you’d simply have to be a fool to fail to listen. I am honored to give my unqualified recommendation to Jon, and honored to count him friend and ally.”\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theconsigliori?trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    ### Pat Turner\n    \n    “Jon did an excellent presentation for the Tennessee Recruiters Association.

There is an incredible opportunity to elevate the work of healthcare professionals and deliver stronger care for patients around the world. In an essay for TIME, Murali Doraiswamy, professor of medicine at Duke University, and I discuss how AI is revolutionizing medicine, including: • Flagging subtle abnormalities in scans and slides that a human eye might miss. • Speeding up the discovery of drugs and drug targets. • Providing patients faster and more personalized support, from scheduling to flagging side effects But we’ve also seen that over-reliance on AI can lead to “deskilling” — in which medical professionals become less effective. That underscores the importance of approaches that keep humans at the center, such as the Intelligent Choice Architecture (ICA), where AI systems don’t make decisions but nudge providers to take a second look at results, weigh alternatives, and stay actively engaged in the process. The future of work is humans and AI agents working together. If we commit to designing systems that sharpen our abilities, we can combine the promise of AI with the critical thinking, compassion, and real-world judgment that only humans bring.

The company context suggests a marketing agency rather than a company with internal support/IT operations facing ticket management challenges.

Queries are extended search strings written in Boolean syntax which determine what sort of information Sherlock+ pulls in from the web to analyze.  \n      \n    In this case, the query was based on associated language, hashtags, and names of people on featured speakers lists. This query was then used to populate a dashboard, built to identify the follow features of any conversation:  \n      \n    Influencers  \n    Topics of conversation  \n    Media, forums and blogs.  \n      \n    For this particular set-up, we focused on influencers and topics.  \n      \n    One of the biggest influencers identified during the festival was Sandy Carter, formerly IBM’s General Manager of Ecosystem Development and Social Business. Carter conducted her own research and found out that “innovate” was the word of the festival, both on the ground and then online. She explained that the word was used 650,000 times over the first weekend of the festival alone, which breaks down to a rate of 8.2 mentions a second on average. While these mentions can’t all be linked to SXSW conversation, many of them were.  \n      \n    Carter herself hosted a session on artificial intelligence and bots at the festival this year. One of the most notable pieces of advice she gave for brands was that “bots are more memorable than apps”, offering a stronger, deeper way to reflect your brand and engage with consumers more efficiently.

During my close collaboration with her on several hard to fill Locum staffing needs for multiple sites over the course of two plus years. I witnessed first-hand her unwavering commitment to securing coverage and providing relief for the existing team, all while diligently recruiting permanent physicians. Tammy is upbeat, positive and always maintained her professionalism. She maintains a calm, composed demeanor, consistently approaching any obstacle with a professional and solution-oriented mindset. Throughout our interactions, Tammy consistently displayed exemplary professionalism, effective communication, and genuine compassion for the individuals involved. Collaborating with her was an absolute pleasure and I sincerely hope to have the opportunity to work with her again in the future. Without any reservations whatsoever, I wholeheartedly recommend Tammy for any undertaking she chooses to pursue. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please feel free to reach out to me if you require any further information.

There are no signals of managing support operations, IT teams, customer success, or service desks. No mentions of ticket systems, resolution processes, agent turnover, or operational chaos in support/IT contexts. The company appears to be a small digital agency rather than a 50-1,500 employee organization with scaling support challenges. His operational focus is on marketing service delivery and business growth, not support/IT operations.",

Many IT companies are moving forward for agile development strategy for building their web applications. Though there are various web application development frameworks available on internet, most of the frameworks do not adapt agile development strategy and also lack standard web application design architecture. So, many customers come up with the ideas but developers or business analyst from IT industries doesn’t have any framework by which they can have a quick (agile) prototype of the idea.  \n    The proposed system decided to design framework by which developers can develop web application from scratch within a very quick time. Proposed framework will perform application bootstrapping by using MVC (Model View Controller) approach which is standard web application design architecture. Idea of customer is transformed into class diagram which will be an input to the framework. The framework provides various drag and drop UI components which will be used for designing interactive web pages. The framework comes up with the new feature called as injection point which will let you add your own widgets. Injection point is a facility to customize the framework according to the needs of customer. Thus, the proposed framework provides a quick prototype by using combination of standard software architectural patterns MDA (Model Driven Architecture) and MVC.
