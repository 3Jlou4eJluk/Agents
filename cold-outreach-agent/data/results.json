He genuinely puts his team first, always thinking about how he can support us, help us grow, and make sure we’re set up to do our best work. What really stood out to me is how approachable and kind Amit is. I always felt like I could talk to him about anything, whether it was work-related or just needing a bit of guidance, and he was always there to listen and offer thoughtful advice. It made a huge difference knowing that I had a manager who truly cared. Amit strikes an amazing balance between giving you the space to own your work and always being there when you need support. That hands-off but always-present style helped me grow so much in my role at DocuSign. He’s more than a manager! He’s a mentor, a friend, and just a genuinely great person to work with. I’m incredibly grateful for the time I got to work with him, and I can’t recommend him enough to anyone lucky enough to have the chance.”\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/adeel-sadiq-0894440289?trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    ### Yohan Uhdre\n    \n    “Amit is an exceptional manager who unites the team and maintains a positive work environment.

I am writing this post to connect with potential new colleagues, employer or simply building connections. Time truly flies! I still vividly remember the excitement and joy of joining the Belgium Cisco TAC in 2012. Incredibly grateful for the journey! I had glorious past years working for Cisco Systems, alongside the best folks whom I value a lot and would love to stay in touch with. No goodbye's from me ;) to any Cisco folks, just saying Thank You, will definitely miss the vibe. As I explore new opportunities, I want to reach out to our amazing community. If you're looking for a team player, problem solver, leader, network specialist, mentor, or trainer, I’d love the chance to collaborate and contribute to achieving great results together. Happy to contribute in various ways: 1. Collaborating to discuss network infrastructure challenges. 2. Providing independent consulting services. 3. Joining your team as a colleague. Have Fun!\n    \n      [24](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fandrisfeher%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_social-actions-reactions) [1 Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fandrisfeher%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_social-actions-comments)\n    \n    [\n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fandrisfeher%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_like-cta)\n    \n    [](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fandrisfeher%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_comment-cta)\n    \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n    \n*   [\n    \n    Andris Feher reposted this\n    \n    ](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/andrisfeher?trk=public_profile__posts_face-pile-cta)\n    \n    *   [Report this post](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fchloe-liaskou-4808a741_senior-technical-support-engineer-activity-7292227722964008960-xeqH&trk=public_profile__posts_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n    \n    [Andris Feher reposted this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chloe-liaskou-4808a741_senior-technical-support-engineer-activity-7292227722964008960-xeqH)\n    \n    [Chloe Liaskou](https://gr.linkedin.com/in/chloe-liaskou-4808a741) \n    \n    ### Chloe Liaskou\n    \n    8mo\n    \n    [Andris Feher reposted this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chloe-liaskou-4808a741_senior-technical-support-engineer-activity-7292227722964008960-xeqH)\n    \n    I am hiring!

As a leader within that organization, I learned more about myself and how I handle different challenges than I ever thought I would, and that self-awareness is something that can not be understated. A huge thank you to Kunal Adak - your guidance over the last few years helped me grow and learn in ways I never could have managed on my own.

great pleasure that I write this recommendation for Andris, who undoubtedly stands out as one of the most exceptional managers I've had the privilege of reporting to. Throughout my time under his guidance, Andris proved to be not just a manager, but a mentor of the highest caliber. His approach to leadership was truly transformative, and every interaction with him was an opportunity for growth and learning. Andris possesses an innate ability to nurture talent and bring out the best in his team members. Despite leading a team of 10-15 engineers in a demanding environment, he consistently ensured that each individual received personalized guidance aimed at enhancing their technical skills, managerial capabilities, soft skills, and overall professional development. His commitment to fostering growth was evident in every aspect of his leadership. One of Andris's most commendable traits was his unwavering focus on his reports. Despite the demanding nature of our workload, he always prioritized the needs of his team members, offering unwavering support and guidance. He maintained a keen eye on our progress, actively tracking our development and working closely with each of us to help us achieve our goals. I vividly recall my initial interaction with Andris, during which I shared a list of three goals I aspired to achieve. With his characteristic warmth and enthusiasm, Andris not only embraced my objectives but also devised a strategic plan for each one, guiding me every step of the way. His dedication to my success was palpable, and I often felt that he was more invested in my goals than I was myself. Reflecting on my time under Andris's leadership, I am struck by his embodiment of the ideal manager. His commitment to individual growth, his unwavering support, and his unparalleled mentorship truly set him apart. It is without hesitation that I recommend Andris to any organization seeking a leader who is not only capable but also deeply invested in the success and development of their team members and business needs.”\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://qa.linkedin.com/in/yahia-elamin?trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    ### Bert Gevers\n    \n    “If you are looking for a no-nonsense people leader, Andris is your man!

Then act like one. Over the years, I’ve scaled teams across various sized companies, from early days Nvidia, to Apple (iPod, iPhone) to Nest Labs, Humane, coached future Leaders, and built orgs from the ground up. I’ve seen both great and horrific displays of leadership. And let me tell you this: Titles don’t make leaders. Actions do. Promote from within Stop searching for saviors outside, your next star is likely already on your team and if not, you are just not great at hiring or likely at developing talent. Share the damn credit If you’re getting applause alone, you’re failing! Pass the mic or step off the stage as much as you can. The team’s credit is by default your credit. Give stretch assignments (and support them!) High potential talent grows when pushed but just don’t leave them hanging. Get them out of their comfort zone and be the safety net for them to push through their fears. Clear the roadblocks Leadership means making space for others to run, not watching them trip on red tape. Be forward thinking and strategic, provide air coverage. Invest in their growth Don’t just talk development; fund it! Calendar it, and follow up. Speeches alone won’t work, follow through with actions. Give feedback that sharpens, not sugarcoats Real leaders tell the truth, even when it stings. You will find they care more about progress than comfort and appreciate transparency and honestly. Know their goals better than they do If you don’t know where they’re trying to go, don’t act surprised when they leave to find those goals elsewhere. Provide a space to for continuous performance development. Stand in front of your people, not behind them When the storm hits, be the shield and not the finger-pointer. Leaders lead with accountability and none on a team should bear more accountability than the leader. Let’s be honest, leadership is hard. Fucking Hard!  It’s not a title. It’s not a checklist. It’s a lifelong commitment to growth, discomfort, and reinvention. The best leaders I’ve worked with evolve constantly. They invest in themselves so they can invest in others. I don’t care how smart or strategic you are, if you’re not building careers while you build your teams, you’re not a leader. You’re THE Ceiling. Leadership is legacy work. The way you show up today determines how many future leaders walk through the door tomorrow. I want to be judged not by how I perform but rather by how people in my org are performing and ultimately, I want to see as many of my leaders competing against me in the industry. #Leadership #FutureofWork #Recruiting #Responsibility #CareerWork #TalentDevelopment #TeamBuilding #EvolvingLeaders #NoExcuses\n    \n       269\n    \n    36 Comments\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josecong_leadership-futureofwork-recruiting-activity-7356021353721835521-edJu?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    Ashley Goldsmith\n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-goldsmith-136507?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts_face-pile-cta)[I’m a big fan of data because it gives you a clear picture of where you are and informs your next steps.The findings in Workday’s latest Global Workforce Report point to a quiet but significant talent crisis. Top performers are leaving at higher rates, growth and mobility are stalling, and employees are feeling disconnected from AI strategy. It’s a challenge leaders cannot afford to ignore. But here’s the good news: there’s a path forward. By prioritizing development and growth, being crystal clear about vision and strategy, and positioning AI as a powerful partner that elevates human potential, organizations have an opportunity to reverse these trends and build a more engaged and resilient workforce.

Hiring has always carried substantial weight in enterprise talent functions. Every decision made, every role filled, has implications that extend far beyond the immediate need. It impacts delivery timelines, cost alignment, capability depth, and team structure. And over time, these decisions shape not just output, but culture and continuity.  According to SHRM, the average cost per hire in the U.S. exceeds $4,700. In high-complexity environments, that number adds up quickly when factoring in opportunity cost, sourcing redundancy, offer drop-offs, and misaligned placements. Even so, most enterprises have no choice but to treat hiring as a series of workflows to manage, rather than as a strategic capability to design and implement. To put it simply, hiring has outgrown the frame it was given; it is witnessing a silent revolution. Most organizations have strong talent teams, clear policies, and sourcing engines in place. However, what has been missing is the infrastructure to connect it all, ensuring every hiring decision is made with complete visibility into internal availability, skill alignment, sourcing viability, and business timing. This is the gap we’ve addressed with Spire.AI Copilot for Talent - not by adding more steps to the process, but by re-architecting the system that surrounds it.  Think of it like modern navigation. You don’t just enter a destination; you receive turn-by-turn updates based on traffic, detours, weather, and speed. The system adjusts in real-time because it maintains a live view of the entire terrain. Hiring should work the same way for an enterprise.  When a role opens, the system should already know where movement is possible, what capacity exists, which sourcing path has the highest fulfillment probability, and how timing aligns with delivery risk. Once the direction is set, execution should be autonomous, with no delays in approvals, outreach, or prioritization. That’s the level of decision support hiring has always needed.   We didn’t set out to streamline the recruiting process. We set out to support hiring as it truly is - a high-frequency, high-stakes decision-making system that deserves enterprise-grade infrastructure. If your teams are rethinking how hiring should work, not just faster but better connected to how the enterprise moves, I’d welcome the opportunity to collaborate.

How do I get one?” If you’re ready to make HR as strategic as the products you sell, here’s how to build the business case, win executive buy-in, and design experiences that drive revenue, margin, and customer delight. One of my posts last week asked: “Should HR have a Product Manager?” It went viral. Most of you said: YES. Now the real question is: “How do I actually get one?” If HR wants to operate like a growth engine, we need to stop designing processes in isolation and start building experiences like products - for employees and the customers they serve. Because here’s the reality: a broken employee experience shows up as a broken customer experience. That’s where an HR Product Manager comes in. Step 1: Speak Business, Not HR Your CEO and Chief Product Officer don’t want “another HR role.” They want ROI. Position the HR PM as a lever for: -Revenue growth: Faster onboarding = quicker time-to-productivity for customer-facing roles. -Margin improvement: Automation and workflow fixes reduce OpEx and wasted effort. -Customer delight: When employees are equipped and engaged, customers feel it. Consider this: A mid-sized company I know of ($500M revenue, 12% margin) was bleeding $18M annually in inefficiencies - manual HR processes, rework, poor onboarding. Adding an HR PM cut those costs by 22% in a year, shortened time-to-hire by 35%, and lifted customer satisfaction by 12%. Step 2: Define the HR PM mission This isn’t about running job postings. It’s about: -Owning the HR tech roadmap: Integrated, intuitive, measurable. -Designing workflows like products: Reduce friction for employees and managers. -Scaling experiences: Onboarding, career paths, and performance systems that drive business goals. -Applying agile: Iterate continuously - not “once-a-year” HR projects. Step 3: Paint the outcomes What does success look like? -Faster hiring in revenue-critical roles. -Lower attrition where turnover kills customer experience. -Improved revenue per FTE through efficiency. -Customer loyalty strengthened by a workforce that’s enabled and engaged. The Pitch: “Give HR a PM and we’ll deliver HR like a product - designed, tested, and tied to the P&L, while creating experiences that drive growth inside and out.” Because great products require great teams, and great teams require great experiences. That doesn’t happen by accident. It’s built.\n    \n       309\n    \n    84 Comments\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elainepage_you-convinced-me-hr-does-need-a-product-activity-7355688503801724928-LNKD?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    Puneet Arora\n    \n    ](https://in.linkedin.com/in/puneet-arora-talentacquisition?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts_face-pile-cta)[\n    \n    A few years ago, Talent Acquisition was seen as a function that simply filled open positions. Today, the game has changed. Organizations that treat TA as a strategic partner are discovering something powerful: hiring can fuel business growth. When your TA strategy is aligned with business goals, hiring stops being transactional. It becomes a differentiator. You’re not just filling roles for today — you’re building leaders and skills for tomorrow. Here’s how that shift happens: 🔹 Start with the business roadmap — know which roles are critical to success. 🔹 Build a sourcing mix that reduces dependency and optimizes cost. 🔹 Focus on quality and retention, not just speed. 🔹 Use data to anticipate talent needs before they arise. 🔹 Strengthen your employer brand so the right talent chooses you. A TA strategy that doesn’t just deliver hires — it delivers business impact, agility, and competitive advantage.\n    \n      54\n    \n    2 Comments\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/puneet-arora-talentacquisition_a-few-years-ago-talent-acquisition-was-seen-activity-7365932222920519681-Qj0p?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    Warren Wang\n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/warrenwangfin?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts_face-pile-cta)[\n    \n    I spoke to a dual-hat CLO who loves being a CHRO, and he said: Every decision HR makes must do 1 of 3 things: 1. Protect and elevate your culture. If you can’t build respect into every part of the business, nothing else matters. Culture isn’t a poster in the break room. It’s a thousand daily choices and the courage to remove toxic influences, even when it’s uncomfortable. The discipline to stand up for the quietest voices. The wisdom to remember that trust, once broken, is nearly impossible to win back. People remember how you make them feel, not just what you pay them. 2. Drive real business impact He challenged the stereotype of HR as process police or compliance cop. If you want a seat at the table, speak the language of the business. He shared how he dove into financial data, questioned assumptions, and found benefit costs that were out of sync with reality, saving the company real money. True HR leaders get curious, ask the hard questions, and learn how operations, finance, and people all connect. Most teams never go beyond the surface. Great HR is about finding where people and profit intersect and making both stronger. 3. Build practical, cross-functional partnerships Stop working in silos. He learned this as both a lawyer and an HR exec: “Don’t just give legal answers; give business answers that comply with the law. If you treat finance and legal as roadblocks, you’ll get nowhere. The best HR leaders coach, challenge, and invite every function to the table.” Push your lawyers for solutions, not just warnings. Challenge your finance team when the numbers don’t add up. If someone can’t collaborate, treat it as a real performance issue. That’s the test. Every hire. Every policy. Every restructuring. Some decisions create instant wins. Others, like transforming a culture or redefining cross-team trust, can take years. But if your move doesn’t protect your people, create measurable business value, or break down silos, don’t do it. Because real HR isn’t just about process. It’s about building a place where people thrive, business grows, and trust outlasts any policy. Nothing more. Nothing less. h/t Joshua Horenstein Follow Warren Wang for more HR and business insights.\n    \n       147\n    \n    44 Comments\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/warrenwangfin_i-spoke-to-a-dual-hat-clo-who-loves-being-activity-7349048505274957824-0iZo?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    Anupam Trehan\n    \n    ](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/anupam-trehan-55a1483?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts_face-pile-cta)[So, I am trying something new this time around, so bear with me! AI is everywhere in my world right now - whether I’m chatting with colleagues, peers, clients, or even my children, AI is the topic du jour. From reshaping how we work to tackling the risks and challenges of adoption, there is a lot to unpack. Over the next four weeks, I’ll be dropping a video each week to dive into different topics- Let’s start by talking about how AI is redefining work. Whether you are a global and / or large organization or a startup, AI is changing the game— driving efficiency, enhancing experiences, unlocking key insights and more. Also, any conversation on AI is incomplete without talking about data, privacy and security. In this week’s video, I’m sharing a few ways AI is transforming work and how at Cisco we are helping our customers embrace AI responsibly.

Right brain creates the movement. At our recent offsite, Varun spoke about something that’s still ringing in my head: the balance (or imbalance) between left and right brain thinking in business. As humans and especially in business we often default to left-brain thinking. Why? Because it feels safer. It’s measurable, rational, and linear. It gives us the comfort of control; forecasts, frameworks, KPIs, and dashboards. It's rewarded early in life; clear answers, right formulas, logical deductions. But here’s the catch: left brain thinking leads to progress, not to differentiation. If we want to build truly distinctive businesses, ones that people remember, talk about, and come back to; we need to lean into right-brain thinking. The part that feels the customer’s emotion. That obsesses over storytelling. That sees around corners and imagines what doesn’t yet exist. That’s where brand love is born. That’s where long-term business moats are built. It’s not either/or. It’s both. The best leaders and the best companies learn to move fluently between the rational and the emotional, the analytical and the intuitive. Thank you Varun, for the nudge to make space for creativity in a world obsessed with logic.

He's incredibly smart, of course, but my favorite quality is the passion and intellectual curiosity he brings to everything he does. Danny has the rare combination of being technical and great with process and tools, while always keeping a \"customer first\" mindset. He brings a toolkit of best practices and deep experience to draw from, while also constantly exploring ways to optimize and improve things. Danny is always looking for how to solve problems in a better, more efficient way, and loves learning about new innovations. At the same time, he understands the big picture, and grasps the financial and organizational considerations required in a leadership role. He's a great people manager and collaborates well with just about anyone. Aside from leading and collaborating with GTM teams, he's also fantastic at collaborating with product teams to drive updates and innovations to help uplevel the impact delivered to customers. During our time working together, he completely revamped the customer enablement and training for a huge customer base (it was a BtoB product but operated more like a BtoC as we supported Amazon sellers, who are largely solopreneurs). He used data to understand where things were working and where he could optimize, and he was able to figure out how to approach problems and design solutions through a combination of people, tools and process. He constantly found ways to drive results while keeping costs under control, but always ultimately worked to drive customer engagement and impact to build advocacy. On top of all that, Danny is a super nice, fun, interesting and engaging human! Truly, any company would be lucky to have him!”\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-yehaskel-4b71a?trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    ### Larry Llodra\n    \n    “I had the pleasure of partnering with Danny on the existing-customer sales side, where his guidance and strategic approach created numerous opportunities for deeper/more mutually beneficial customer partnerships. As the VP of Customer Success at Jungle Scout, not only did he build the team from scratch and grow it into the stable unit that forges on today, but he also fostered a culture of openness and collaboration that allowed it to self-correct quickly when needed (at times in more ways than one). This paired with his willingness to get his hands dirty from time to time (a secret weapon when needing to turn things a round with a challenging partnership), helped many of us navigate a shifting competitive industry and capitalize on opportunities as they arose; sometimes in ways that were initially hard to see on one's own. Danny is truly an exceptional leader, and I hope we will have the chance to work together again somewhere down the line.”\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larryllodra?trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n    \n\n14 people have recommended Danny\n\n[Join now to view](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/public-profile-join?vieweeVanityName=danvil&trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n\n## View Danny’s full profile\n\n*   See who you know in common\n*   Get introduced\n*   Contact Danny directly\n\n[Join to view full profile](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/public-profile-join?vieweeVanityName=danvil&trk=public_profile_bottom-cta-banner)\n\n## Other similar profiles\n\n*   [Daniel Hayward](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwnhayward)\n    \n    ### Daniel Hayward\n    \n    San Francisco, CA\n    \n    [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwnhayward?trk=public_profile_browsemap_browse-map_connect-button)\n    \n*   [Matt Fingerhut](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewfingerhut)\n    \n    ### Matt Fingerhut\n    \n    Seattle, WA\n    \n    [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewfingerhut?trk=public_profile_browsemap_browse-map_connect-button)\n    \n*   [David Sakamoto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsakamoto)\n    \n    ### David Sakamoto\n    \n    San Francisco Bay Area\n    \n    [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsakamoto?trk=public_profile_browsemap_browse-map_connect-button)\n    \n*   [Daniel Rose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielrosecxsuccess)\n    \n    ### Daniel Rose\n    \n    Customer Success Executive | Cybersecurity + AI | GTM & Revenue Obsessed | CX, Digital and Technical Services Ops & Strategy | Grateful Human | Big Family Dad\n    \n    Salt Lake City Metropolitan Area\n    \n    [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielrosecxsuccess?trk=public_profile_browsemap_browse-map_connect-button)\n    \n*   [Alexis Bourdamis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisbourdamis)\n    \n    ### Alexis Bourdamis\n    \n    Chicago, IL\n    \n    [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisbourdamis?trk=public_profile_browsemap_browse-map_connect-button)\n    \n*   [Palance Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/palanceharris)\n    \n    ### Palance Harris\n    \n    Frisco, TX\n    \n    [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/palanceharris?trk=public_profile_browsemap_browse-map_connect-button)\n    \n*   [Stephanie Roodhouse](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-roodhouse)\n    \n    ### Stephanie Roodhouse\n    \n    San Francisco Bay Area\n    \n    [Connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanie-roodhouse?trk=public_profile_browsemap_browse-map_connect-button)\n    \n*   [Nivine K.

I report directly to the CTO and I lead a multidisciplinary squad, including a Tech-Leader.  \n    I have core business metrics such as CAC, but also product-related metrics, such as converstion rate of PQLs, Customer Effort Score (in new features), Time to Value, etc. My team is responsible for developing demands of new features and improvements. I have to prioritize them to create sprint calendars considering technical effort, debugging, code review, quality assurance, and deploy. My first task was to launch the new version of a trial, considering the framework of PLG to reduce bumpers and decrease the TTFV metric, in order to convert more PQLs after a custom digital onboarding focused on the customer's needs. Every event was logged in both MixPanel and Hubspot, so that I have a data-driven process from discovery to the ongoing. I am also working in a new feature discovery, aligned with the Design Team to interview, wireframe and prototype a solution which would expand our core business activity. Since the discovery phase is very subjective, I always take into consideration leading and lagging indicators, to help me make adjustments and track the progress to have always better processes.

She'll quickly spot problems, understand them, and jump into brainstorming smart solutions to unblock initiatives, internal processes, and, especially, the customer's experience. I admire how her skill set is so wide and flexible. Izzy doesn't limit herself to a box. If a problem needs solving, and she doesn't have the technical skill to do so, she'll simply learn the skill. I love this, as willingness to learn is one of the most valuable skills someone can have in the workplace. She'll expand herself to help the business. All of that makes her great asset for any team, and it doesn't stop there: Izzy is simply a great person with such a positive energy, whether it's in the office or out in happy hours.”\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://br.linkedin.com/in/marinamilk?trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    ### Tales Menezes\n    \n    “A Iza está trabalhando com a gente para implantar a Triple Session na Blip e desde o início tem se dedicado ao máximo.

During the event, iTech/Ampcus made a notable presence by sponsoring two holes on the course. Our team was actively engaged, offering refreshments, giveaways, and delicious food to all attendees. It was a proud moment when our golf team secured a tie for 1st place on the White Course. While the top scores emerged from the Green Course, we cherish our performance and the significant role we played in advancing such a vital mission. With a turnout of over 170 golfers and supporters, the day was brimming with joy, camaraderie, and meaningful contributions.

It was a delight to watch her passion (and grit!) shine brightly. From the boardroom to the programs she helped launch to the partnerships she forged with other organizations – Pam’s ability to authentically connect with people intentionally and purposefully in order to build community has been one of the great joys of my life to witness.   Pam always believed in working together, be it with her team, the WBE business community, corporate members, agencies, RPO’s or other nonprofits. Through these collaborations, she helped shepherd [WBENC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wbenc?trk=public_profile__posts-text) to new heights – 21,000-plus WBE members and 500-plus corporate, agency and nonprofit partners, each of whom she managed to address with respect.    But it was how she did these things – forming connections, building community, creating collaborations – and the way she wrapped her work in that non-negotiable respect for the individual that, for me, defines Pam’s legacy. We lost a pioneer this week, but she left behind a beautiful roadmap to do this work and keep building.   With heart. With smiles. With love and words and laughter. With authenticity, generosity and intention. And above all else – together.   From all of us at Ampcus and the Ampcus group of companies, thank you, Pam, for all that you’ve done for us and the entire business community.   My dear friend. My sister, Pam – Sweetie. Rest well and rest in peace. 💔\n    \n    [public\\_profile\\_\\_posts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ampcus-inc_a-message-from-ampcus-founder-ceo-anjali-activity-7346563649051803649-qweT)\n    \n     \n    \n       [287](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fjamieleone%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_social-actions-reactions) [9 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fjamieleone%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_social-actions-comments)\n    \n    [\n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fjamieleone%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_like-cta)\n    \n    [](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fjamieleone%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_comment-cta)\n    \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n    \n*   [Jamie Petriashvili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamieleone) \n    \n    ### Jamie Petriashvili\n    \n    3mo\n    \n    *   [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjamieleone_sharing-profile-of-an-excellent-resource-activity-7341465200274894848-8suj&trk=public_profile__posts_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n    \n    [Jamie Petriashvili shared this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamieleone_sharing-profile-of-an-excellent-resource-activity-7341465200274894848-8suj)\n    \n    Sharing profile of an excellent resource!\n    \n    [Jennifer Haskins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-haskins-1889405) \n    \n    ### Jennifer Haskins\n    \n    3mo\n    \n    [Jamie Petriashvili shared this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamieleone_sharing-profile-of-an-excellent-resource-activity-7341465200274894848-8suj)\n    \n    Hi everyone!

A woman recently told me, “The Buyers are rubbed the wrong way by the WoW Awards — they say you have to pay to win.” Then, in the same breath, she asked for a discount to our [ClubVMSA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/clubvmsa?trk=public_profile__reactions-text) SF Enterprise Roundtable event if she could “refer 5 buyers we don’t know.” The irony? She's actually a WoW Finalist. When I asked, “Do you give this same feedback to other conferences?” she said, “Not at all — never.” And there it was — the truth behind the “feedback.” Here’s the reality: At [WoW: Women of Work](https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-of-work?trk=public_profile__reactions-text), you can be nominated, selected, and celebrated — from the Top 500 list to the Top 100 Finalists — without spending a single dime. WoW was built to elevate women, not sell them validation. It’s heartbreaking when criticism comes from the very people you created something to uplift. But that’s also part of leadership — knowing that some will misunderstand your mission while others will be transformed by it. The world doesn’t need more critics — it needs more builders, believers, and connectors. As we prepare for WoW 2025 — just six weeks away — I’m more grounded than ever in the mission: ✨ Celebrate women boldly. ✨ Stand firm in integrity. ✨ Lead with courage, not compromise. She ended our call saying, “Now I see your true colors.” Yes — my true colors are as follows: 💎 I speak my mind. 💎 I stand up for what I believe in. 💎 I protect the integrity of my work and the women it represents. 💎 I don’t fold when challenged — I rise higher. Because at the end of the day, the right people will feel your energy, not your edits.

We scored first and had all the momentum. Then the other team came out firing in the second half, and suddenly the scoreboard flipped. I told him — this is life, my friend! You’re going to have moments when things go your way, and moments when they don’t. What matters isn’t the score — it’s that you keep playing hard, stay locked in, and show up for your teammates no matter what. We ended up losing, but the effort was there. The energy was there. The pride was there. And I have no doubt we’ll get another shot in a few weeks — a little tougher, a little smarter, a little hungrier. Whether it’s sports, sales, or leadership — the lesson’s the same: You don’t control the highs or the lows.

The three prior nominations to this list were blocked from a photo op due to 1) a year with no CWS due to a pandemic, 2) a year with no sponsors (and very little attendance from Game Changers) the first year of CWS after the pandemic and 3) a trip to the ER during the 2024 CWS conference.

There was never a time she was not available to share insights and knowledge, help resolve challenges, strategize, review goals, or jump on a client call. One thing that stands out most for me is even in tough situations she was able to calmly help us step back, evaluate, and determine a resolution - but most importantly made sure we ended with a smile and knowing we had her full support. It was an absolute privilege to work under her leadership.”\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinhfootdale?trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    ### Karen (Ferry) Meyer\n    \n    “Kirsten is a fierce leader who consistently prioritizes her customers’ and team’s interests and needs.

Melanie operates first with kindness and second, with direct communication. We were very much partners through the recruiting process for each role, and she was very transparent with me by providing feedback promptly, allowing us to pivot quickly (which is easily the biggest challenge in working with hiring managers as a Recruiter!). Goals changed throughout a few processes, but Melanie was willing to truly be a hiring partner by putting forth the extra legwork necessary to hit hiring date targets, while under a time crunch. She's a team player with an effervescent work ethic; her energy is contagious and encourages people around her to want to work hard. I hope I have the pleasure of working with Melanie again in the future!”\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-dyas?trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    ### Shahzil (Shaz) Amin\n    \n    “Mel is one of the hardest working and most genuine people I've met.

I can sit here and talk about how hard she works 24/7 and how she excels at all the different tasks thrown her way without throwing a fit all day, but that's a given. Her true gift is not only the ability to inspire the people she meets, but to find ways to help them out however she can. She gets immense gratification out of seeing others succeed, which I believe helps her succeed.

What we sometimes forget is that behind every project and every success story are people — colleagues who show up every day, contribute their best, and keep things moving forward. A few words of recognition can go a long way in making someone feel valued, energized, and motivated to give their best. A Personal Moment That Stuck with Me Not too long ago, I received a short note from the head of another function. It wasn’t long or formal — just a quick acknowledgment: \"Hey – I appreciate the work you're doing. Thank you.\" It was just one line. But it carried weight. That moment reminded me how powerful recognition can be, especially when it comes from someone who isn’t directly tied to your role or your team. It wasn’t about performance reviews, KPIs, or metrics. It was simply a human-to-human appreciation. Why This Matters When we take the time to appreciate our colleagues: We build connection: A simple “thank you” bridges silos and strengthens relationships across teams. We inspire productivity: Recognition fuels motivation, often more than incentives or targets. We create culture: A culture of appreciation makes workplaces not just productive, but joyful. Appreciation doesn’t cost anything, but it creates ripples that can transform how people feel about coming to work every day.\n    \n       [70](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_social-actions-reactions) [5 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_social-actions-comments)\n    \n    [\n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_like-cta)\n    \n    [](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__posts_comment-cta)\n    \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n    \n*   [Nipun Mohanty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nipun-mohanty) \n    \n    ### Nipun Mohanty\n    \n    1mo\n    \n    *   [Report this post](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fnipun-mohanty_certificate-of-completion-activity-7363348041828888577-LMRp&trk=public_profile__posts_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n    \n    [Nipun Mohanty shared this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nipun-mohanty_certificate-of-completion-activity-7363348041828888577-LMRp)\n    \n    Just finished the course “Introduction to Prompt Engineering for Generative AI”!

That weird phase where growth is brewing but nothing’s visible yet? After recently wrapping up my adventure at Infosys, I’ve been chewing on why moving on feels like peeling an onion — layered, emotional, and occasionally tear-inducing — even when you know it’s the right recipe for growth. Over the weekend I was giving a thought to my old world. It wasn’t the role or the responsibilities I missed — it was the map I’d memorized. The familiar routes, the landmarks, the version of me who knew exactly where to go and what to search. Now, I’m somewhere new, and the compass is recalibrating. I am in a fog state of mind. Not lost — just somewhere between the familiar and the new. I’m learning to sit with both the uncertainty and the curiosity — like standing in a foggy valley between two mountains. The old peak is behind me, familiar and well-trodden. The new one is just beginning to emerge through the mist. And somewhere in this quiet middle, I can feel the contours of a new beginning forming — not just a new role, but a new Rythm of me. It’s the space where curiosity begins to stretch its legs, questions bubble up, and new possibilities quietly start to surface. It’s that strange, stretchy middle ground — after you’ve let go of the old, but before the new has fully arrived. Like a caterpillar in a cocoon, you’re no longer who you were, but not yet who you’re becoming. Yes, it’s uncomfortable — like standing in a room where the furniture’s been rearranged and you’re not quite sure where to sit. But it’s also where the seeds of change are planted. Because real growth doesn’t happen in the spotlight. It happens in the cocoon. Would be great to hear your thoughts? Have you undergone such transition periods leading to growth?\n    \n    [public\\_profile\\_\\_reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shripriya-ranade-8380a824_growth-doesnt-happen-in-the-spotlight-activity-7379823882842734592-ubIs)\n    \n     \n    \n      [34](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__reactions_social-actions-reactions) [3 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__reactions_social-actions-comments)\n    \n    [\n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__reactions_like-cta)\n    \n    [](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__reactions_comment-cta)\n    \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n    \n*   [\n    \n    Nipun Mohanty liked this\n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nipun-mohanty?trk=public_profile__reactions_face-pile-cta)\n    \n    *   [Report this post](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fharijayaram_semiconwest-makeitmaterial-activity-7382594265983610880-Xvdq&trk=public_profile__reactions_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n    \n    [Nipun Mohanty liked this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harijayaram_semiconwest-makeitmaterial-activity-7382594265983610880-Xvdq)\n    \n    [Hari Jayaram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harijayaram) \n    \n    ### Hari Jayaram\n    \n    5d\n    \n    [Nipun Mohanty liked this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/harijayaram_semiconwest-makeitmaterial-activity-7382594265983610880-Xvdq)\n    \n    Today at [#SEMICONWest](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fsemiconwest&trk=public_profile__reactions-text) [Applied Materials](https://www.linkedin.com/company/applied-materials?trk=public_profile__reactions-text) introduced new semiconductor manufacturing systems that boost the performance of advanced logic and memory chips foundational to AI computing.

Battlefield 6 is finally here. It’s hard to capture what it means to see this come to life — not just the game itself, but everything behind it: the collaboration, the scale, and the shared determination across Battlefield Studios and all our partners who made it possible. As Head of Operations, I’ve had the privilege of standing at the crossroads of it all — watching teams from different studios, cultures, and disciplines move in sync toward one vision. That’s where the real magic happened. There were challenges, and there were moments of pure inspiration — moments where you could feel the power of a united team building something extraordinary together. Those are the moments that remind me why I do what I do. I’m incredibly proud of this team — of their ambition, their craft, and their belief in one another. It’s been an honor to help guide that energy toward something this bold. To everyone — our teams, partners, and players — thank you for being part of this journey. We said we’d get there. And we did. See you on the Battlefield.

But good discovery isn't just about nailing the first conversation, the best discovery happens consistently throughout the entire deal cycle. I often see salespeople get derailed with objection handling. Objections can feel like rejection which puts all of our emotions, doubts and insecurity on high alert for fight or flight. Next time you hear an objection - take a deep breath and respond by first asking a question to gain more insight on the heart of the concern. Shift your perspective and build confidence by knowing - objections are simply an opportunity for deeper discovery. Don't give up, keep digging.\n    \n       [149](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__reactions_social-actions-reactions) [26 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__reactions_social-actions-comments)\n    \n    [\n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__reactions_like-cta)\n    \n    [](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile__reactions_comment-cta)\n    \n    *   Copy\n    *   LinkedIn\n    *   Facebook\n    *   X\n    \n\nNo more next content\n\nSlide to item 1 Slide to item 2 Slide to item 3\n\n[See all activities](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fch%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fin%2Fnipun-mohanty%2Frecent-activity%2F&trk=public_profile)\n\n## Experience\n\n*   [\n    \n    #### Seclore\n    \n    12 years 4 months\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/seclore?trk=public_profile_experience-group-header \"Seclore\")\n    *   [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/seclore?trk=public_profile_experience-item_profile-section-card_image-click)\n        \n        ### VP of Customer Success & Professional Services\n        \n        #### [Seclore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/seclore?trk=public_profile_experience-item_profile-section-card_subtitle-click)\n        \n        Apr 2023 - Present 2 years 7 months\n        \n        San Francisco Bay Area\n        \n        As the VP of Customer Success at Seclore, I spearheaded the customer success and delivery function for our Direct & OEM customers, ensuring optimal outcomes at every turn.

It was truly one of the most valuable experiences I’ve had in my professional journey. Over the course of five sessions, Simona shared insights drawn from her rich experience in the industry. She was practical, thoughtful, and incredibly effective at helping me tackle complex challenges with straightforward, actionable guidance. At a time when I was feeling stretched by the demands of a new role, the workload, and a lot of uncertainty, Simona helped me find clarity, set priorities, and rebuild my confidence. What stood out most was her rare combination of sharp intellect and emotional insight. She genuinely cared and always knew how to meet me exactly where I was. Her empathy and willingness to help—even offering her support beyond the formal sessions—made a lasting impression. Simona is without question one of the leading voices in the customer success space.

Intercom is proving what’s possible. Here’s what’s setting them apart and what every SaaS founder, builder, and exec should pay attention to: ✔️ Get focused, fast: Centralize your AI talent and organize teams around high-impact missions. Intercom didn’t scatter their best minds — they united them. ✔️ Rebuild, don’t just retrofit: AI can’t be an afterthought. Intercom rewired their tech and made their codebase something AI tools could amplify. ✔️ Prototype relentlessly, launch boldly: Intercom’s internal “taste tests” and backtesting frameworks enabled them to spot when technology was ready and when it wasn’t. ✔️ Reshape how value is delivered: Forget seat-based pricing. AI is only as valuable as the outcomes it delivers. Intercom only charges for what matters — Fin’s resolved conversations. ✔️ Empower builders, not just specialists: Siloed roles are out. Intercom champions product-minded generalists and design engineers while doubling down on a core team of AI experts. The bottom line? Thriving in AI means not just layering on LLMs, but re-architecting tech, teams, pricing, and culture.

Now it's time to rethink how we deliver services. It’s time to rethink the way services are delivered. Our CXO Grover Amit breaks down the shift toward productized service models. Software as a Service Is Maturing. What’s Next? Services as a Product. Over the past two decades, I’ve witnessed the IT services industry undergo seismic shifts, from on-premise systems to the SaaS explosion, from waterfall to agile, and now from software to intelligence. But today, a new shift is quietly emerging: Services are beginning to behave, and be valued, like products. At InnovationM, we see this transformation unfolding every day. Clients no longer want mere \"service hours\", they want predictable outcomes, reusable frameworks, faster time-to-market, and scalable impact. That’s not traditional service delivery, that’s productized thinking applied to services. Whether it's a reusable module for onboarding workflows, a UI/UX accelerator kit, or pre-built AI engines, services are no longer just built to order; they’re being built to scale. This mindset shift demands more than technical excellence. It requires strategic engineering, balancing customization with reusability, and agility with standardization. At InnovationM, our teams are intentionally designing delivery frameworks and micro-components that can be reused, adapted, and evolved, turning one project’s success into a client-wide advantage. In short, we're not just solving problems, we're building solution assets. As SaaS continues to mature and commoditize, the real differentiator will lie in how IT partners like us evolve service delivery into productized, value-driven ecosystems. The future isn’t just in writing great code, it’s in designing systems, frameworks, and teams that deliver repeatable innovation. That’s where InnovationM is headed. And I believe, that’s where the industry must go. #ThoughtLeadership #ProductizedServices #InnovationM\n    \n     19](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/innovationm_thoughtleadership-productizedservices-activity-7358932269606060032-rjor?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts) \n    \n*   [\n    \n    Oxide Computer Company\n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oxidecomputer?trk=public_profile_relatedPosts_face-pile-cta)[Per-core license, per-socket license, it doesn't really matter.

Not just a number but a collection of lessons, pivots, stretch moments, and quiet wins that shaped how I work, lead, and think. It’s no longer about the number of projects, calls, or campaigns. It’s about what we learn and build together. Instead, I count: 🔹 The times I said “I don’t know” and then learned 🔹 The moments I helped someone grow, even just a little 🔹 The decisions I made with imperfect data, but clear intent 🔹 The balance I tried to keep between ambition and empathy This past year brought new responsibilities, unfamiliar territory, and higher expectations not just from others, but from myself. I’m proud of the work I’ve done. But even more, I’m proud of who I’ve become doing it. Grateful for the people who challenged me with trust, feedback, and kindness. Excited (and a little nervous) about what’s next. That’s how I know I’m still growing. Special thanks to the mentors and leaders who shaped this journey for giving me direction, ownership, and space to grow.

With this funding, we’re set to elevate our vision for AI and GenAI-powered customer experiences and engagement to the next level. Up until today, [Insider.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/useinsider?trk=public_profile__posts-text) has disrupted the industry in two prominent ways. 1. From our earliest days, we built a compound SaaS platform. Unlike traditional companies that focused on a single area or product, our approach was different. We built multiple industry-leading solutions that outperform single-point solutions and other vendors in every way. 2. Insider has been a leader in AI for more than a decade. We were one of the first players in the market to combine predictive AI models with customer experience technologies. We were in a prime position to incorporate [#GenerativeAI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fgenerativeai&trk=public_profile__posts-text) natively within our platform. We are on the brink of an AI era that will truly disrupt the MarTech industry, and Insider will be the disruptive force leading it. Today, we disrupt the industry again, by securing the single largest funding round received by a woman-founded MarTech unicorn in history. As a company born in Europe, we expanded across more than 28 regions. Today, we power the customer experience for iconic brands across North America, Europe, Asia, MENA, and Latin America.

This milestone is a testament to an incredible journey filled with growth and unforgettable experiences. From the very beginning, Insider's dynamic and innovative environment has been a driving force. Collaborating with brilliant minds, all sharing a common goal, has been nothing short of inspiring. We've broken barriers, tackled challenges head-on, and celebrated remarkable achievements together. One memory that stands out is when we successfully launched a major project in a new market, expanding our footprint into [#LATAM](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Flatam&trk=public_profile__posts-text). The teamwork and dedication shown by everyone involved were truly remarkable. Another unforgettable moment was our expansion into [#NORTHAMERICA](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fnorthamerica&trk=public_profile__posts-text), where we faced and overcame significant challenges, solidifying our presence and achieving impressive results. In these six years, I’ve worked in 3 different countries, with 5 different leaders, in 6 different roles, with over 250 clients, 750 business contacts, and more than 1500 colleagues. These numbers are hard to justify, but that’s what makes them so special.

I can’t believe I’ve already reached this milestone with [Insider.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/useinsider?trk=public_profile__reactions-text) This stage of my professional career feels different. I’ve always had a passion for intentionality in my professional career. Lately, I’ve been emboldened with a sense of heightened awareness, within myself and the teams I’m a part of. This organization has allowed me to exist in a space where I can feel discomfort, express it, and be heard and appreciated. When I first started here, I was hoping it would uphold the expectation I had set for it to be a place where ideas are appreciated and people are effectively collaborating toward a common goal. This team and organization have exceeded those expectations in ways I couldn’t have predicted. I’ve grown in ways equally unimaginable. One of the few commonalities we all share is imperfection. It is only through recognition of our imperfections we are able to grow and evolve for the better. This is the mindset I’ve adopted over the last year, but I’ll accept there is still room for more growth. I’m just excited to see what it brings. Here’s to year 2 and those to come.

Having been in this space for a while now, what really stood out to me about MoEngage was its vision to be the most trusted Customer Engagement Platform for customer-obsessed brands. After being with the company for some time, I've realized it's not just a mission statement, but a blueprint that guides every action and decision across our teams. I have always been a builder at heart, and the thoughtful product innovation and pace at which MoEngage builds were a huge draw for me. From building a warehouse-native approach to personalization, to rapidly advancing generative agents for marketers, to launching AI Decisioning—we move fast, yet stay intentional about creating real impact for brands. For product marketers, that means we’re constantly racing to keep up with all the cool things our product and engineering teams are building (a great problem to have!).

I really didn't need to send follow up reminders or anything as Kevin was always extremely reliable. I would highly recommend Kevin as someone for a client-facing role. His personality is warm and friendly and he can get along with all types of people. Even with tight deadlines, I always felt confident that I could rely on Kevin to be transparent with me and let me know whether a deadline could be met. Once we aligned any timelines for projects, Kevin always made sure that timelines were adhered to and I was never let down.”\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-wainberg-58745468?trk=public_profile_recommendations)\n    \n*   [\n    \n    ### Rick Acampora\n    \n    “I have known Kevin for roughly 20 years.

He has helped me, my team and my clients and done so with urgency and at speed. In addition to all of the above, Kevin is one of the very best people in our business and industry. Smart and always on top of things...yes. Always thinking about your business and ways to help...yes. Always about your client’s and your team’s agenda...yes.
