Leadr solves these 5 growing pains: conflict avoidance, disengaged team members, low productivity, unclear goals, and high turnover.

When we don’t equip our managers to succeed in these areas, our teams remain ineffective, and it’s our bottom line that takes a hit. (21% less productivity, 43% higher turnover, and 22% lower profits). 

Think of it this way, if you have 100 full time employees, disengagement and turnover are costing you around $1,680,000 annually.

With scattered processes, lack of visibility, and no accountability, technology becomes the only solution to help an organization win. 

In Leadr’s digital workspace, managers lead effective meetings, engage in helpful feedback, put goals into action, develop every team member, and recognize wins on a personal level. 

Having all of these things in one place allows visibility for executives, alignment for leaders, and clarity for employees — all leading to increased performance."
